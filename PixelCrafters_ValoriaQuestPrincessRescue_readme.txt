1. Start scene file: Scenes/StartScene

2. How to play
2a. Use WASD keys to move the player in the scene. 
2b. Collect collectibles like swords, keys, energy potions and gems throughout the maze. 
2c. You will need a specified number of keys to unlock each door.
2d. You will need a specified amount of energy level to defeat each ghost. If you come in contact with a ghost while not having enough energy, the game will end.
2e. The ghosts are AI controlled and run away from the player. The player needs to catch the ghosts to collect keys
2f. There are some dummy/fake doors in the maze. If you unlock such a door, the game ends.
2g. You need to be able to collect all the keys and defeat all the ghosts to open the golden door and win the game.

3. Known problem areas:
3a. Camera movement behind player - the camera offset needs to be perfected so that the skybox outside the maze is not visible
3b. Rigid body physics of the player- the player sometimes starts to float away after a strong collision
3c. Ghost AI glitch - sometimes requires time to move to state where it has to run away from the player
